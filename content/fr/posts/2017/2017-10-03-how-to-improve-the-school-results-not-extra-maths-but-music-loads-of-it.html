    <p>  <br>Summary of article by Josh Halliday The Guardian Nine-year-old Abiha Nasir's journey at Feversham Primary Academy illustrates the transformative power of music education. Initially shy, Abiha's musical talent blossomed through the school's emphasis on music, drama, and art integrated into every aspect of the curriculum. Under the leadership of Headteacher Naveed Idrees, the school has achieved remarkable academic success, despite its diverse and economically challenged student body. By prioritizing music, the school has witnessed improved pupil progress and overall well-being. Through a Kodály-inspired approach, children learn vital skills such as rhythm and movement, enhancing their literacy and numeracy abilities. Moreover, music serves as a catalyst for social and emotional development, addressing concerns about children's mental health and resilience. The school's innovative approach challenges the prevailing emphasis on standardized testing and underscores the essential role of creative subjects in nurturing well-rounded learners. Abiha's passion for music exemplifies the school's success in fostering talent and confidence among its students, reflecting the broader impact of music education on individual lives and communities.
