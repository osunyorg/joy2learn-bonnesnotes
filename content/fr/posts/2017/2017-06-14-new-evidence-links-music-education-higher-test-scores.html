    New Evidence Links Music Education, Higher Test Scores

    <p>  <br>Summary of article by Tom Jacobs  Pacific Standard The recent study from Canada provides compelling evidence that continued music education may indeed lead to higher academic performance among high-achieving high school students. While it's true that the correlation observed does not definitively prove causality, the consistently higher grades of students who chose music courses suggest a potential link between music education and intellectual benefits. One possible explanation, proposed by Perlovsky and his colleagues, revolves around music's ability to help individuals cope with cognitive dissonance. This discomforting feeling arises when we encounter information that contradicts our beliefs, and the ability to manage it may foster intellectual and emotional growth. This hypothesis aligns with the idea that music played a crucial role in human evolution by facilitating social bonding and promoting resilience in the face of challenges. Moreover, the study raises the question of whether music education contributes to the development of confidence, self-esteem, and social connectedness, which are all factors that could positively influence academic performance. Future research could explore these potential mechanisms underlying the observed correlation between music education and higher grades. Ultimately, the study underscores the multifaceted benefits of music education and highlights the importance of incorporating arts programs into school curricula. As educators continue to navigate the complexities of promoting academic success and holistic development among students, music education remains a valuable tool worth further exploration and investment.
