        <p>Summary of article by Eva Amsen <br><i>Forbes</i></p><p>Despite the ongoing pressure on schools to make budget cuts, a recent extensive study from the University of British Columbia in Canada highlights the importance of music education. Analyzing data from over 100,000 students at public high schools, the study reveals that students who took music lessons in high school performed better in subjects like English, science, and math. Unlike previous studies, this research corrected for factors like students'prior performance and socioeconomic background, showing a clear positive impact of music lessons on academic performance. Moreover, students who played musical instruments performed even better than those who sang, possibly due to the demanding nature of learning an instrument and playing in an ensemble. While the study doesn't definitively explain why music leads to better academic performance, it suggests neurological changes, motivational factors, and enhanced social development as potential explanations. Regardless of the reasons, the findings underscore the importance of continuing to provide music education in high schools.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/evaamsen/2019/06/25/high-school-students-do-better-in-science-math-and-english-if-they-also-take-music-lessons/">Source</a></p>
