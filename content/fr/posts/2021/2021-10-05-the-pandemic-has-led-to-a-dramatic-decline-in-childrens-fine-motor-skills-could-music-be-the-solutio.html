        <p>Summary of article by Sophia Alexandra Hall <br><i>Classic FM</i></p><p>Over the past 18 months, the shift to online learning has led to a decline in children's fine motor skills, particularly in areas like handwriting. With digital delivery dominating education, practical music lessons have taken a backseat, depriving students of crucial hands-on experiences. The diminishing practice of in-hand manipulation, essential for handwriting, has been noted by teachers, contributing to students falling behind in this area. Moreover, the lack of catch-up systems exacerbates the situation, leaving many struggling to develop muscle memory necessary for precise handwriting. Music education emerges as a potential solution, as learning a musical instrument has been linked to improved fine motor skills. Studies have shown that consistent practice offers immediate feedback, refining motor responses and enhancing accuracy and speed. As schools prioritize practical music lessons upon reopening, there's hope for a resurgence in fine motor skills, offering a much-needed boost to students' handwriting abilities and muscle memory. With music poised to play a pivotal role in addressing these challenges, its integration into the curriculum becomes more vital than ever, underscoring its importance in nurturing well-rounded individuals.</p><p><br><a href="https://www.classicfm.com/music-news/could-music-help-pandemic-decline-children-motor-skills/?fbclid=IwAR29LJ7-cfM0Z1Of4CGw1GhLxotJCUFqHVQ5Jy3VeeB3dFblXwlXa9r8C-4" target="_blank">Source <span class="sr-only">(lien externe)</span></a></p>
