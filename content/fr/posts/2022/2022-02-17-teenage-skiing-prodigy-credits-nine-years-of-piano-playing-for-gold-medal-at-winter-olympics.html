    <p>  <br>Summary of article by Sophia Alexandra Hall  Classic FM Eileen Feng Gu, also known as Gu Ailing, made history at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games by becoming the youngest gold medalist in freestyle skiing's big air event. Juggling her prowess on the slopes with her passion for playing the piano, Gu attributes her success to her musical background, using rhythm and visualization techniques from her piano playing to execute daring aerial tricks. Her decision to attempt a challenging jump she had never landed before paid off, earning her the gold medal. Gu's story, which intertwines her dedication to skiing and music, reflects her desire to break boundaries and inspire others, particularly young athletes. Raised by her Chinese immigrant mother in America, Gu's diverse upbringing, which included skiing, soccer, ballet, and piano lessons, underscores her commitment to both sports and music. Off the slopes, Gu spends her downtime playing the piano and composing music, emphasizing the importance of her musical pursuits alongside her athletic endeavors. As she heads to Stanford University, her mother's Alma Mater, Gu's journey embodies resilience, talent, and the power of pursuing multiple passions. Source</p>
