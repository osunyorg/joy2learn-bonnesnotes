    Making music, changing lives: Youth orchestras help at-risk kids

    Summary of article by Elizabeth Thompson North Carolina Health NewsFrom a youth string orchestra at the Chatham Youth Development Center to programs teaching music to underprivileged children, music has demonstrated its transformative power. Inspired by her incarcerated uncle's experiences, Bethany Uhler Thompson initiated Chatham Strings, providing incarcerated youth with opportunities for creativity, teamwork, and accomplishment through music. Although the program was halted by COVID-19 and Thompson's relocation, its impact remains evident. Anecdotal evidence suggests that music involvement can aid in recovering from trauma, fostering positive learning experiences, and developing essential interpersonal skills. Similarly, Kidznotes, a Durham-based program, has shown improved school attendance and academic performance among students from lower-income areas. While Donald Hodges argues that music's effects aren't magical but rather neurological, it remains a unique and deeply human form of expression. Music's ability to create community, promote responsibility, and offer joy transcends age, cognitive ability, and circumstances, making it a vital source of healing and connection even in the face of adversity like the COVID-19 pandemic.Source
